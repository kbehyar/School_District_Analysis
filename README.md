# Overview of the school district analysis:

### Purpose:

The purpose of this project is to analyze the data provided from several schools within a district based on their student's performance on a Math and Reading examination to determine their performance and to provide insight to help the district make strategic decisions 

Our original analysis was based on the student population within each school, math and reading scores between grades 9 - 12 and the budget allocated to each student.

We were recently notified of a case of academic dishonesty within Thomas High School were asked to re-adjust our original analysis by omitting the grade 9 math and reading scores from our data.
